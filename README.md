Space Engineer C# In-Game Scripts

Space Engineers is an open world space exploration game with resource gathering, refining, and industrial level crafting. Which are used to build stations, ships, and remote controlled drones. In the game there are programmable blocks that run C# scripts on triggers. I have never programmed in an object oriented language, so join me as I use this environment to learn.
